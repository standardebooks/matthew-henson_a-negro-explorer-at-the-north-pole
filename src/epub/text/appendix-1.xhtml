				<p epub:type="title">Notes on the Eskimos</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>The origin of the Eskimos is not known to a certainty. In color they are brown, their hair is heavy, straight, coarse, and black. In appearance they are short, fat, and well-developed; and they bear a strong resemblance to the Mongolian race.</p>
			<p>Among the men of this tribe, quarrels and fights very rarely occur; but it is a very noticeable fact that while the men of the tribe do not make war on each other, the man of the family will, at the least provocation on the part of his better-half, without hesitation apply brute force to show his authority.</p>
			<p>The tribe of these, the North Greenland Eskimos, numbers two hundred and eighteen.</p>
			<p>Great interest was shown by the men when working implements, such as we used on board ship, were shown them. Eagerly they listened while the uses of many of these tools were explained to them. The women also showed great interest in any article that was foreign to them. They have a special liking for fancy beads of the smaller variety.</p>
			<p>The Eskimos show a great capacity for imitation. They have also a marked sense of humor.</p>
			<p>An Eskimo’s sense of imitation is so keen that it is only necessary for him to observe a sledge-maker at work but once, when the same type of sledge will be reproduced in a very short time. On my last trip north, I noticed that the shirts worn by the Eskimos were similar in style and cut to our own. In 1906, the style had been entirely different.</p>
			<p>The Eskimos show no desire to acquire the English language. With the exception of Kudlooktoo and Inighito, none of the tribe could speak English intelligently. The Eskimos’ vocabulary is a complication of prefixes and suffixes, and many words in his language are very hard to pronounce.</p>
			<p>The <i xml:lang="ale">tupiks</i> (tents) are made of sealskin, and are used in summer. The igloos are built of snow, and are used in winter. A few igloos built of boulders can be seen. The workmanship of this latter type of igloos is necessarily crude, for the boulders are used in the rough state. On entering the <i xml:lang="ale">tuscoonah</i> (entrance), a bed-platform of stones five feet long, and six feet wide, confronts one. On each side of this platform are seen smaller platforms, each holding a <i xml:lang="ale">koodlah</i> (fire-pot).</p>
			<p>This <i xml:lang="ale">koodlah</i> is made of a stone so soft that before it comes in contact with fire it can easily be cut with a knife. The name given by the Eskimos to it is <i xml:lang="ale">okeyoah</i>. Cooking utensils are first formed in the desired shape, then heat is applied, as a result of which the stone quickly hardens. The method of cooking as employed by the Eskimos is to suspend the <i xml:lang="ale">kooleesoo</i> (cooking-pot) over the <i xml:lang="ale">koodlah</i> (fire-pot). The <i xml:lang="ale">koodlah</i> is the only means by which light can be secured in an Eskimo igloo. As fuel, the blubber of the narwhal is used.</p>
			<p>The clothing of the male Eskimo consists of a <i xml:lang="ale">kooletah</i> (deerskin coat with hood attached), <i xml:lang="ale">nanookes</i> (foxskin trousers) and <i xml:lang="ale">kamiks</i> (sealskin boots); that of the female Eskimo, a <i xml:lang="ale">kopetah</i> (foxskin coat with hood attached), <i xml:lang="ale">nanookes</i> (foxskin trousers) and hip length <i xml:lang="ale">kamiks</i> (sealskin boots). The shirts of the male and female Eskimo are made from the skin of the auks, and one hundred and fifty of these little birds are used in the manufacture of one shirt.</p>
			<p>The largest Eskimo family known among the North Greenland tribe, numbers six; as a rule, an Eskimo family rarely outnumbers three. An Eskimo family is not stationary. Rarely does a family remain in one place longer than one season, which is nine months. The principal reason for this constant moving is the scarcity of game; for after a season of hunting in one place, game becomes very scarce; and there is no other alternative but for the family to move on. Transportation is by means of sledges drawn by a team of dogs. Alcoholic drinks are not known among this tribe; but, of late, tobacco is extensively used. Previous to 1902, before the arrival of the Danes, tobacco was an unknown quantity.</p>
			<p>The cleanliness of the Eskimos leaves room for much improvement.</p>
			<p>With reference to their morals, strictly speaking they are markedly lax. The wife of an Eskimo is held in no higher esteem than are the goods and chattels of the household. She may at any time be loaned, borrowed, sold, or exchanged. They have no marriage ceremony.</p>
			<p>The amusements of the Eskimos are few. Tests of strength and endurance occur between the men of the tribe; and visits are paid to the various settlements, during the long winter nights; and songs and choruses are sung, accompanied by a kind of tambourine which is made from the bladder of a walrus or seal, and stretched across the antlers of a reindeer.</p>
			<p>The Eskimos are a very superstitious people. In the event of a fatal illness, the victim, just before death, is removed to a place outside the igloo, for should death enter the igloo that dwelling would instantly be destroyed. If the deceased be a man, he is rolled up in a sealskin, and strips of rawhide are lashed around the body to keep the skin intact. He is then carried to his last resting place. A low stone structure is built around the body to protect it from the foxes. His sledge, containing all his belongings, is placed close beside this structure, and his dogs harnessed to his sledge are strangled, and stretched their full length, with their forepaws extended. In the event of the deceased being a woman, her cooking utensils are placed beside her, and should she be the mother of a very young infant, its life is taken. In the case of a widower, the bereaved Eskimo remains in the igloo for three days, during which time a new suit of wearing apparel is made, and worn by him, and all clothing made by the deceased, is, by him, destroyed. His term of mourning now being ended, the Eskimo, without more ado, takes unto himself a new wife. Members of the tribe who have the same name as the deceased have to change that name until the arrival of a newborn babe, to whom the name is given, whereby the ban is removed. The Eskimos have no decided form of religion. When questioned as to where the soul of the good Eskimo will go, they reply by pointing upward; and by pointing downward, the question is answered as to the final dwelling-place of the wicked.</p>
			<p>The main cause of death amongst the Eskimos is from a disease the symptoms of which are a cough, nausea, and fever, which disease quickly causes death.</p>
			<p>It is true that the Eskimos are of little value to the commercial world, due probably to their isolated position; but these same unlearned and uncivilized people have rendered valuable assistance in the discovery of the North Pole.</p>
